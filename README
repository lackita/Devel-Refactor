Devel/Refactor version 0.06
===========================
The Devel::Refactor module is for code refactoring.  Give it a file and the
desired refactoring, and it will create a patch file describing the changes
needed to perform that refactoring.

Supported Refactorings
======================

extract method
--------------
Let's say you want to extract the code in Foo.pm, starting at character 200,
going for 20 cahracters, and called bar:

	refactor.pl Foo.pm extract_method bar 200 20

This will produce a file in your current directory called refactor.patch, which
will describe the changes needed to perform that refactoring.

Editor Support
==============
Check out the editors directory for extensions for various editors:

emacs
-----
editors/emacs/perl-refactor.el

	(require 'perl-refactor)

Mark a region that you want to refactor and do the following:

	M-x perl-refactor RET <new name> RET

This will apply the patch and show you the diff of what happened.

   perl Makefile.PL
